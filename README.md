### Question 2 - 
### What's your proudest achievement? It can be a personal project or something you've worked on professionally. Just a short paragraph is fine, but I'd love to know why you're proud of it, what impact it had (If any) and any insights you took from it?\

When I joined this company I was less familier with the kotlin and MVVM framework as earlier I worked more upon MVC. The project I was working upon was using latest tech stack and tools. it was having very tight deliveries and complex applications. In the starting I faced many challenges while knowing the business model, tools used and process but I worked so hard (spent more hours in office), slept less to deliver things on time and with adequate quality and eventually I was awarded "Certification of appreciation" for that particular work. The timelines were so tight that even senior team members were also spending more hours in office but since I was new I was supposed to learn and start coding parallelly, I had to put more effort to get the deliveries on time.
Now due to more working I am very good in kotlin, java and MVVM architecture. In this short span of time I have got exposure in lot of things including technologies, agile methodolgies and few non technical things as well.
